# Overview
This method was designed for my kin's reference in case needed. It walks through the process of retriving the cold stored coins (Ethereum  & Bitcoin specifically but the method could be used by heaps of other coins as well) offline in order to interact with them. I will start from the initial set-up in case someone else finds this usefull.
We will be creating a booteable USB to access a fresh copy of Ubuntu from where we are going to create / access our wallets to interact with them offline with a set of open source tools.

# You will need
1. Computer (mac, pc, laptop, desktop, any will do)
2. 2 x USB drives
3. Pen & paper
4. Smartphone

# Booteable USB creation
