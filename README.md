Method for cold store ethereum &amp; bitcoin safely

# Overview
This method was designed for my kin's reference in case needed. It walks through the process of retriving the cold stored coins in a safe way (without exposing the private keys / passphrases online) in order to send them somewhere. I will start from the initial set-up in case someone else finds it usefull.
